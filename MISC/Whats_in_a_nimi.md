In this challenge, we have a very cryptic text written using strange symbols. By using Google Lens or a similar service, we find many pictures of glyphs, and the images most similar to this one contain the text: "Toki Pona."

Toki Pona (tok: toki pona) is a constructed language (conlang) that has a writing system called sitelen pona (literally "good writing"), which is exactly the same as the one employed here.

We can therefore transliterate the text, obtaining the following:

> mi mute li kulupu ni: jan pi kama sona. mi mute li kama sona e sona pi ilo sona.
> mi mute li tan ma [Italija].
> ni li pona tawa mi mute: mi mute li toki suli e utala sin.
> tan ni ale la mi mute li sitelen kepeken toki pona. toki pona li pona anu seme?
> jan ale li toki e toki pona. sina toki ala toki e toki pona?
> toki pona li toki pali. jan [Sonja] li pali e ni.
> ona meli li tan ma [Kanata]. ona meli li wawa mute.
> mi mute ale li wile kama sona e toki pona. sina wile ala wile kama sona e toki pona?
> sina wile pali e ni: sina tawa sona e toki pona. ni la sina ken lukin e lipu mute.
> len sitelen li ni: nimi pi nanpa pini "lipu tenpo".
> ni li sama e [KSUS]"{" len sitelen "}".
>               tan jan [Samele]

Which might be translated into:

> We are a group of this: students. We study knowledge about knowledge devices (computer science)
> We are from Italy
> This is good/happy for us: we announce a new challenge.
> Because of this all, we write using toki pona. Isn't toki pona good?
> toki pona is a constructed language. Person Sonja works on it.
> She is from Canada. She is very strong.
> We all want to learn toki pona. Do you want to learn toki pona?
> You want to work on this: you learn toki pona. In this context, you can look at several books/publications/papers.
> The written textile/secret (flag) is this: the name of the last edition of "lipu tenpo".
> This is equal to ksus{flag} (uses the format indicated, reasonably).
>               by person Samele (Samuele)

The name of the last edition of the magazine "lipu tenpo" is "nanpa kala". We can try to submit "ksus{nanpa kala}" as the flag.

```ksus{nanpa kala}```

Also accepted with underscores, capital letters, etc.
